Hello Everyone.

Due to FM25 being cancelled, i desided to make a minor "one off" update..
Meaning that it's NOT a direct Sas24 update as i have removed some stuff that i didnt like.

But it also means a few new things and some fixes,adjustments and corrections of things i left undone in Sas24

Enjoy the extended FM24 and Sas2025Final

***** IMPORTANT *****
There will NOT be a laptop version..
There will NOT be running support, it is as you see it.
